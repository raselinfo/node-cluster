# NodeJS Cluster ðŸ”¥

## What is NodeJS Cluster?

Node. js runs single threaded programming, which is very memory efficient, but to take advantage of computers multi-core systems, the Cluster module allows you to easily create child processes that each runs on their own single thread, to handle the load.

## What is Blocking and Non-blocking operations?

Blocking refers to operations that block further execution until that operation finishes while non-blocking refers to code that doesn't block execution. Or as Node. js docs puts it, blocking is when the execution of additional JavaScript in the Node. js process must wait until a non-JavaScript operation completes.

## NodeJs Cluster modules

- A single instance of nodejs run in a single thread
- Cluster module allows to take advantage of multi-core system
- It help to create child process which shares server ports

## Working of Cluster

- Worker processes are spawned using the fork() method
- These processes can communicate with parent via **IPC**
- They can also communicate from parent to child and child to parent.
- The cluster module supports two methods for distributing incoming connections
  - **Round Robin**
    - This is default on all platforms except windows.
    - The master process listen on a PORT, accepts a new connection and distribute them across the workers in a round-robin fashion
  - Second Method
    - The master process create the listen socket and sends it to interested workers
    - The workers then accept incoming connections directly

### What is IPC

The high-speed **interprocess communication** (IPC) interconnect is a high-bandwidth, low latency communication facility that links the nodes in the cluster. The interconnect routes messages and other cluster communications traffic to coordinate each node's access to resources.
