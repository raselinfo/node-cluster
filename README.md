## What is Blocking and Non-blocking operations

Blocking refers to operations that block further execution until that operation finishes while non-blocking refers to code that doesn't block execution. Or as Node. js docs puts it, blocking is when the execution of additional JavaScript in the Node. js process must wait until a non-JavaScript operation completes.
